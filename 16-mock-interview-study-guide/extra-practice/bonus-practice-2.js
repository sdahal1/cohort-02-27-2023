/* 

Write a function called getFormattedCoinData that accepts a coin name as a parameter and uses this api endpoint (which part of this url can change depending on the function parameters?): https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/bitcoin

The function should output a promise that resolves an OBJECT that has this format (How would you get the key "coinName" to be there even if the api doesn't have a key called "coinName"?

{
    coinName: "Bitcoin",
    genesis_date: "2009-01-03",
    usd_price: 20681,
    ath_usd: 69045
